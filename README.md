So here is how you can make a *perfect* medium rare tuna steak just like me: use bluefin tuna not that shitty yellow one or god forbid canned tuna, make sure you pat it down on both sides with a paper towel (moist stops it from searing) and add salt (like a lot of salt) and pepper (if you want). Heat up your pan and add a bit of sesame oil and grapeseed oil. Toss in a lemon slice in there. Put the fish in the pan (lay it down away from you unless you like the warm touch of hot oil) and sear on medium high heat for 45 sec on each side, then cook it for 15-20 seconds on low heat on each side (you don't want a raw interior). When it's done leave it rest for 3 or 4 minutes
